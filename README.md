# fastText classifier example

This code trains a fastText model like proposed by Joulin et al [1] for sentiment classification of reviews with PyTorch. 

I used the Yelp Review Polarity Dataset which is available at Xiang Zhang's Google Drive dir [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M?resourcekey=0-TLwzfR2O-D2aPitmn5o9VQ) and was used in [2]
